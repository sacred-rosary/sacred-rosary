# Sacred Rosary - Administrator's Guide to Mourning Mode

As the site administrator, you can enable a site-wide mourning mode that overrides user preferences and sets the site to a black theme. This guide explains how to configure and manage this feature.

## Enabling Mourning Mode

To enable mourning mode, edit the `config.js` file and modify the `admin.mourning` section:

1. Set `enabled` to `true`
2. Customize the mourning message
3. Set the start and end dates for the mourning period
4. Ensure `overrideUserTheme` is `true` to force the black theme for all users
5. Set `showBanner` to `true` to display the announcement banner

## Example Configuration

```javascript
admin: {
    // Mourning Mode Settings
    mourning: {
        enabled: true,              // Set to true to enable mourning mode
        message: "We are in a period of mourning for Pope Francis. Please pray for the repose of his soul.",
        startDate: "2025-01-01",    // Format: YYYY-MM-DD
        endDate: "2025-01-09",      // Format: YYYY-MM-DD
        overrideUserTheme: true,    // Force black theme
        showBanner: true            // Show announcement
    },
    // ...other admin settings
}
```

## How It Works

When a user visits the site during the specified period:

1. The site will automatically switch to the black mourning theme
2. The mourning message will be displayed in a banner at the top of the page
3. Users will not be able to change the theme in the settings panel
4. All other user preferences (audio, meditation duration) will still work

## Testing Mourning Mode

To test mourning mode before a real mourning period:

1. Set `enabled` to `true`
2. Set `startDate` and `endDate` to include the current date
3. Refresh the site (you may need to clear your cache with Ctrl+F5)
4. Check that the site appears in the black theme with the mourning banner
5. Try changing the theme in settings to verify it's locked
6. When done testing, set `enabled` back to `false`

## Forcing Cache Refresh

To ensure all users see your changes immediately, increment the version number:

```javascript
admin: {
    // ...mourning settings
    
    // Site Version - Increment this to force cache refresh
    version: "1.1.1",  // Change from 1.1.0 to 1.1.1
    
    // ...other admin settings
}
```

## Common Scenarios

### Pope's Death

For the death of a Pope, a typical mourning period is 9 days (Novemdiales):

```javascript
mourning: {
    enabled: true,
    message: "We are in a period of mourning for Pope Francis. Please pray for the repose of his soul.",
    startDate: "2025-01-01",
    endDate: "2025-01-09",
    overrideUserTheme: true,
    showBanner: true
}
```

### Good Friday

For Good Friday or other liturgical days of mourning:

```javascript
mourning: {
    enabled: true,
    message: "Today is Good Friday, a day of fasting and abstinence as we remember Christ's Passion and Death.",
    startDate: "2025-04-18",
    endDate: "2025-04-18",
    overrideUserTheme: true,
    showBanner: true
}
```

### National Tragedy

For a national day of mourning:

```javascript
mourning: {
    enabled: true,
    message: "Today is a National Day of Mourning. We pray for all those affected by the recent tragedy.",
    startDate: "2025-05-01",
    endDate: "2025-05-01",
    overrideUserTheme: true,
    showBanner: true
}
```

## Additional Tips

- Always test the mourning mode before a significant event
- Set exact start and end times by configuring the dates properly
- Consider adding a special prayer intention for the mourning period
- Increment the version number to ensure changes are visible to all users

If you have any questions about managing the mourning mode, please refer to the technical documentation or contact the developer.
